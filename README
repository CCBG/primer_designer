Program to design primers for the human references GRCh37

TODO:

1) Investigate if the primers would sequence through a homopolymer
   run, if so annotate them at the top

2) integrate the result from the primer evaluation in to the report

3) add a maximum PCR product length to the
   primer_evaluation. Currently it checks if a primer set would generate
   a product upto 2kbp, but for sequencing we dont want anything longer
   than say 700 bp.

4)
